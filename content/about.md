# Hi there

My name is Dong. I'm 3 years student in RMIT University.

I'm on my way learning to become a Cloud DevOps Engineer. 

Currently, my brain have a huge blank space! ðŸ˜†

The theme includes:

- **light/dark mode**, depending on your preferences
- great reading experience thanks to [**Inter UI font**](https://rsms.me/inter/), made by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)
- nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)

So, there you have it... enjoy!
